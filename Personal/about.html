		<h1>I am Sam.</h1>
		<p>I study Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers University. I stand at a little over six feet tall and am primarily left handed. I love conversations and unique perspectives.</p>

		<p>My passion for programming and aesthetics comes from my parents. My father was a database programmer for Oracle, and inspired my curiosity in computers. My mother is a doctor with an eye for beauty, as she prominently worked in the field of aesthetic medicine. My interest in programming and designing applications led me to Adobe Flash, at the time a Macromedia product. My curiosity was unceasing, and I delved into web design and ran a relatively successful video game website in my teens. In college, I further extended my depth of programming with various freelance work for local businesses. Rick Rubin, a music producer and inspiration of mine, reduces music to what is worth hearing. I'd like to think that I reduce my projects to what is worth experiencing, which is why I put 'Reduced by Sam Goldfield' on them when possible. </p>

		<p>I'm a fan of drinking loose leaf tea and the football club Tottenham Hotspurs. I tweet at the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/samgdf">@samgdf</a>. You can contact me there, or at my email, <a href="mailto:sam@rutgers.io">sam (at) rutgers.io</a>.</p>
