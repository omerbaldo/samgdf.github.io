      <h1><i class="icon-user"></i> Hello. My name is Sam Goldfield.</h1>
      </br>
      <p>I am currently searching for something new. Previously,
      I worked at Access, Wolfram Research, and VICE Media.</p>
      </br>
      <p>I've also worked on some projects, including <a href="http://sniper.rutgers.io/">Rutgers Course Sniper</a> and <a href="http://medicalaestheticsnj.com/">Medical Aesthetics NJ</a>.</p>
      </br>
      <p>My favorite <i class="icon-soccer" title="football" alt="football"></i> team is Tottenham Hotspur. I drink a lot of <i class="icon-leaf" title="tea" alt="tea"></i>. Here is my verification <a href="https://keybase.io/samgdf"><i class="icon-key" title="key" alt="key"></i></a>.</p>
      </br>
      </br>
      <h1><i class="icon-folder" id="blog"></i> 24/01/2017 â€“ <a href="#blog">To Start</a></h1>
      </br>
      <p>Starting something new is always overwhelming. The self doubt that seeps into your skull is staggering. Most of the time, I'm impressed with the amount of ways I can convince myself not to do something. My mental process always includes that I'm not qualified, not experienced, or not able to learn all there is to know.</p>
      </br>
      <p>This self doubt perpetuates because of the way our brains work. You've probably heard that our brain has <a href="http://a.co/6RiY3Gs">two different systems</a>. The first is quick-fire, capable of adding together two small numbers or reading this. The second is for prolonged, slower thought and is more deliberate.</p>
      </br>
      <p>When we consider something that we can't do, it is usually our second system. Historically, this has had biological benefits. A brain that could talk a person out of doing something rash would survive to pass on to the next generation. Because of this, we likely live longer than before, but also have become dangerously domesticated. We are more risk averse now than in any previous time in history. Some of this is commonsense safety, but other regulations can keep us from fulfilling our potential.</p>
      </br>
      <p>In the spirit of my first system, I have decided to ship this yet-unfinished project into the masses. I will be building this project from the ground up, and hope to have some record of my process available on <a href="https://github.com/samgdf/samgdf.github.io">github</a>. I once read an anecdote that Rick Rubin would never claim that he had finished anything, only that he had <a href="https://images.rapgenius.com/ab817e28e03a07c0a22fdd1bf178a045.1000x781x1.jpg">reduced</a> an album to what was worth hearing. In the same vein, I will continue to reduce this website into what is worth seeing. Hopefully, I will have a few interested eyes for the journey.</p>
