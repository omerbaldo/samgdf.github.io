# Rutgers.io Template #

Rutgers.io is the personal portfolio website of Sam Goldfield. Sam is a soon-to-be graduate of Rutgers University, and is still surprised he was not handed a cease and desist letter from the university. This was a private repository for a while, but I figure showing something is better than nothing.
